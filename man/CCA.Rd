}
\arguments{
\item{otu}{otu table}

\item{env}{Environment Factor Data Table}

\item{metadata}{metadata table containing grouping information.}

\item{id_col}{(integer)The column number of the OTU ID column in the
OTU table, by default, is 1.}

\item{group}{(character) Group 1, please enter the column name of
the grouping information in the metadata table.}

(4) environmental factor scores, (5) Analysis of differences between
environmental factors and community structure.

\description{
Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) is a multivariate statistical method
used to study the relationship between two sets of variables. It can reveal
the inherent connections between the two sets of variables. This function
references the \code{cca()} function in the \code{vegan} package for analysis. Prior to
conducting RDA analysis, it is recommended to perform Detrended
Correspondence Analysis (DCA) detection using the \code{decorana} function from
the \code{vegan} package. Selection is based on the Axis Lengths value of DCA1 as
follows: (1) If >4.0, choose CCA; (2) If between 3.0-4.0, both RDA and CCA
are acceptable; (3) If <3.0, choose RDA.
