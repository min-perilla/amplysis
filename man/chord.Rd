chord(
  otu,
  metadata,
  tax,
  id_col = 1,
  tax_cla = "genus",
  group = "group",
  parallel_method = "mean",
  row_n = 8,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{otu}{otu table}

\item{metadata}{metadata table}

\item{tax}{tax table}

\item{id_col}{(integer) The OTU_ID column is in which column,
defaulting to 0 means there is no OTU_ID column, and the data is already
numeric.}

\item{tax_cla}{(character) Taxonomic level. Only column names from the tax
table can be entered, for example tax_cla = 'genus'.}

\item{group}{(Required, character) Grouping information. please enter the column name of
the grouping information in the metadata table.}

\item{parallel_method}{(character) Sample processing methods for the same group:
average, sum, median, none.}

\item{row_n}{(integer) Preserve the top N taxa (including the Nth) based on
abundance, while merging taxa with lower abundance into "others".}

\item{digits}{(integer) When the parallel sample method is set to "mean," the
number of decimal places will default to 0.}

diagram.
