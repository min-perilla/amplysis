\usage{
tax_names_repair(tax, column_to_check, column_to_add)
}
\arguments{
\item{tax}{(data) A table containing classification information.}

\item{column_to_check}{(integer or character) The columns to be repaired, such as column_to_check = 8, column_to_check = c(4:8),
If column names are known, you can also input column_to_check = "column_name"}

\item{column_to_add}{(integer or character) If column_to_check is unclassified, append the column number as a suffix.}
}
\value{
data.frame
}
\description{
In taxonomic information, terms such as \"unclassified\", \"unknown\", \"uncultured\",
\"norank\", \"unidentified\", \"Unknown_Species\", \"Unknown_Genus\", \"Unknown_Family\",
\"Unknown_Order\", \"Unknown_Class\", and \"Unknown_Phylum\" may exist.
When plotting a species composition chart, simply merging these categories may result in the loss of some taxonomic information.

For instance, one entry may be categorized as Firmicutes at the phylum level and as
\"uncultured\" at the genus level, while another entry may be categorized as Armatimonadetes at
the phylum level and also as \"uncultured\" at the genus level. Merging them at
the genus level would result in both entries being classified as \"uncultured\",
leading to the loss of some taxonomic information. The correct approach is to refine
and repair the taxonomic information. In this case, the entries at the genus level should be
specified as \"uncultured_Firmicutes\" and \"uncultured_Armatimonadetes\", respectively,
to preserve the detailed taxonomic information.
