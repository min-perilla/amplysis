  id_col = 1,

\arguments{
\item{otu}{otu table}

\item{tax}{taxonomy table}

\item{metadata}{metadata file}

\item{id_col}{(integer) The column number of the OTU ID column in the
OTU table, by default, is 1.}

\item{tax_cla}{(character) Taxonomic level. Only column names from the tax
table can be entered, for example tax_cla = 'genus'.}

\item{label}{(character) The "label" column in the node file generally comes
from a column name in the taxonomy file, with the default being "phylum".}

\item{group}{(character) Group 1, please enter the column name of
the grouping information in the metadata table.}

\item{parallel_method}{(character) Sample processing methods for the same group:
average, sum, median, none.}

\item{calc_method}{(character) Correlation analysis methods available:
"spearman" or "pearson". The default method is "Spearman".}

\item{cluster_method}{(integer) Clustering method, options range from 1 to 11, with the
default being 1 (Louvain method).

A list of all methods:

"1" = "Louvain (default)",

"2" = "Edge Betweenness",

"3" = "Fluid Communities",

"4" = "Infomap",

"5" = "Label Propagation",

"6" = "Leading Eigen",

"7" = "Leiden",

"8" = "Optimal",

"9" = "Spinglass",

"10" = "Walktrap",

"11" = "Fast Greedy")}

\item{normalize_flag}{(logical) Standardize the columns "eigenvector", "closeness",
"constraint", and "pagerank" in the node file. Default is TRUE.}

\item{.r}{(numeric) Correlation. Default is 0.6, meaning nodes with an
r-value > 0.6 will be retained.}

\item{.p}{(numeric) Significance test p-value. Default is 0.05, meaning nodes with
p-values less than 0.05 will be retained.}
}
\value{
Two CSV files: "edge.csv" and "node.csv".
}
\description{
The feature table, taxonomy table, and metadata file will be processed into
an edge file and a node file. These two files can be imported into Gephi for
visualization (which we also recommend). Additionally, the network() function
has built-in visualization methods, but they are performance-intensive and
may run slower.
